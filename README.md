# Message-Encoding-Decoding
Message encoding decoding using base64 encoding
This is a python based project. In this we have created a gui using tkinter library and base64 module provided by python.
This project enables the user to give a message as an input and a secret key which is only known by user. It further encodes the input provided by the user and decoded if desired by the user itself.

The Base64 encoding is used to convert bytes that have binary or text data into ASCII characters. Encoding prevents the data from getting corrupted when it is transferred or processed through a text-only system.
